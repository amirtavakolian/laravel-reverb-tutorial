how do we start up our reverb server?


first define the database:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=reverb
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

-------------------------------------------------

then run => php artisan migrate

-------------------------------------------------

php artisan reverb:start

now you can broadcast events from your Laravel application.
and your client, will listen to these events that have been broadcast
and you can do something with the data that you're sending.

-------------------------------------------------

php artisan reverb:start --debug

enable debugg option with --debug

we can use it while we're just testing this out so we can see
which data is being sent to our server.

When we start to send events, these will appear here in the command line
so we can see all of the data, which channel this has been pushed on
and when clients connect and disconnect as well.

Now, you don't want to run this in a production environment because the amount of data
 that is coming through will eventually lead to this command crashing.

We'll see that in the last section of this course when we look at sending a huge amount of events.
to our reverb server and we'll probably see it crash.

So we're not always going to want to run the debug option
just while we of course are debugging.
